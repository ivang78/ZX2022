# Source of loader.exe

This is the QT App that lets you upload the Rom image (rom.img) to your Z80 computer via the Arduino Mega. It also serves as serial "Fileserver". I recommend to use Qt 6.0.0 or higher to build the executable. I developed and tested all under Windows 10, but it might also work on other platforms that are supported by QT. I have never tested this, so I cannot tell whether it works.
